A platform to tune an internship opportunity to the fullest. After interns receive an offer at a company, we help them get to know the teams and match them to the team of best fit.
After the matching, we hope to provide a dedicated hub for the intern so that they can monitor their project / day-to-day tasks effortlessly.
